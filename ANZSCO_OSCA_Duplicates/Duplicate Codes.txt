These codes are duplicates and they exist in both OSCA and ANZSCO and some of them are different occupations making analysis at reporting level difficult and confusing. 
Majority of the codes in OSCA are new and never existed before.
Between different versions of ANZSCO, one code always meant one occupation. 
Now one code could imply two different occupations. This sort of ambiguity has been introduced with OSCA.
